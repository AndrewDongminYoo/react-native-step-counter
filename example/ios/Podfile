  This function returns the min iOS version supported by React Native
  By using this function, you won't have to manually change your Podfile
  when we change the minimum version supported by the framework.
  min_ios_version_supported is defined in react_native_pods (current version is 12.4)

  This function prepares the project for React Native,
  before processing all the target exposed by the framework.
  Temporary solution to suppress duplicated GUID error.
  Can be removed once we move to generate files outside pod install.

  If you are using a `react-native-flipper` your iOS build will fail when `NO_FLIPPER=1` is set.
  because `react-native-flipper` depends on (FlipperKit,...) that will be excluded from the build.
  To fix this you can also exclude `react-native-flipper` using a `react-native.config.js`
  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    dependencies: {
      ...(process.env.NO_FLIPPER ? { 'react-native-flipper': { platforms: { ios: null } } } : {}),
  ```
=end
